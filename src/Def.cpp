 * These are functions that have direct implementations in the interpreter
 * and can be used in function application contexts.
 * 
 * Categories:
 * - Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, modulo, expt
 * - Comparison: <, <=, =, >=, >
 * - List operations: cons, car, cdr, list, set-car!, set-cdr!
 * - Logic: not, and, or (and/or support short-circuit evaluation)
 * - Type predicates: eq?, boolean?, number?, null?, pair?, procedure?, symbol?, list?, string?
 * - I/O: display
 * - Control: void, exit
